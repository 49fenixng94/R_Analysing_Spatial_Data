### R_Analysing_Spatial_Data

1. Workout on making map and time-series animation.

This workout is illustrating the development of Covid19 numbers in USA during Jan-Mar 2020 by using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/amitalexander/time-series-covid19-confirmed-us). To keep the coding focusing on the map building and animation, the dataset is modified and the code does not cover this manipulation part.
