### R_Analysing_Spatial_Data

1. Workout on making map and time-series animation.

This workout is illustrating the development of Covid19 numbers in USA during Jan-Mar 2020 by using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/amitalexander/time-series-covid19-confirmed-us). To keep the coding focusing on the map building and animation, the dataset is modified and the code does not cover this manipulation part.

2. Workout with Mapbox API's data

This workout is trying to use Maxbox API's provided spatial data to build the map to show the difference of travelling within the Melbourne CBD by driving, cycling and walking, applying spatial.
